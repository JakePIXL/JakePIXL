# About Me 

Hey there! I'm Jake, a computer science student and current budtender based in Ontario, Canada. My main programming language is Python, but I'm always looking to expand my skillset and try out new technologies, like Rust and embedded programming.

In my career, I'm interested in developing backends and working on complex systems, either as an entrepreneur or within the cannabis industry. Cybersecurity is also a passion of mine, and I love being able to use my problem-solving skills to build efficient and effective solutions. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, staying up-to-date on the latest tech, and working on my endless projects, as I find problems and love to fix them.
