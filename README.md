# About Me 

Hey there! I'm Jake, a cybersecurity student and current budtender based in Ontario, Canada. I mainly develop backends in rust but like to dive into the world of fullstack development with things like svelte/kit and astro.

In my career, I'm interested in developing backends and working on complex systems, either as an entrepreneur or within the cannabis industry. Cybersecurity is also a passion of mine, and I love being able to use my problem-solving skills to build efficient and effective solutions. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, staying up-to-date on the latest tech, and working on my endless projects, as I find problems and love to fix them.
